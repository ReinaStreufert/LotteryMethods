# LotteryMethods
Created to settle an argument about picking numbers for a lottery.

Imagine a lottery in which you are to pick a random number from 0-1000 on each try. During the drawing if your number matches, you win.

Person A says that you'll have a higher chance of winning faster by picking the same number each try.
Person B says that the lottery has no memory, therefore it doesn't matter and you can pick a different number each time without hurting your chances.

So, I created this program in order to settle the argument.
